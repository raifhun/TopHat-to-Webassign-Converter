This set of programs was scripted to convert tophat downloads into webassign pastable format for upload.  It is simply to save a small amount of time instead of going into the tophat xlsx and doing the copying manually.

1. Click on the attendance/content of your choice in Top Hat and click export this page to excel.

2. Run the corresponding python file (attendance or quiz etc) that matches the Top Hat assignment type.

3. Select the downloaded Top Hat excel sheet in the file dialog.

4. Select the save location for the webassign csv.

5. Open the webassign csv in excel and copy it to clipboard like you would for any other excel webassign upload.

** Gated attendance will determine if the student was present at both times but each Top Hat attendance poll must be downloaded separately and exactly two files must be selected in the open file dialog in Python. **
